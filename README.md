# Soundiada

A simple game inspired by 2D embeddings of audio recordings.

You can play here:

https://davidchalupa.github.io/soundiada-intro/

Just click on each point on the screen to play the sound and drag-and-drop the correct label.

Headphones recommended! :slightly_smiling_face:

Enjoy!

## Known issues

The drag-and-drop functionality of the game currently works only in desktop environments. Mobile devices are unfortunately not supported yet.
